# DATEYE UI Design Documentation

Design documentation for the DATEYE desktop application for medical device integration.

## Design Philosophy

DATEYE follows the principle of invisible excellence: The user interface supports medical workflows without interruption while maintaining a professional appearance.

### Core Principles

1. **Clarity**
   - Every element has a clear purpose
   - No purely decorative elements
   - Clear information hierarchy

2. **Simplicity**
   - Clean lines, sufficient whitespace
   - Subtle shadows and depth
   - Professional without sterility

3. **Context Awareness**
   - Adaptation to medical environments
   - Functional on older hardware
   - Readability under various lighting conditions

4. **Reliability**
   - Consistent feedback for every action
   - Clear error states
   - No ambiguities for users

## Visual Direction

### Platform-Native Components

DATEYE uses platform-specific UI components:
- **Windows**: Fluent UI (Windows 11 Design)
- **macOS**: macOS UI (Apple Design Language)
- **Linux**: Yaru (Ubuntu/GNOME Design)

Benefits:
- Familiar operation for users
- Native performance and behavior
- Automatic operating system integration
- Professional appearance for medical applications

### Unified Brand Identity

While respecting platform conventions, DATEYE maintains consistency through:
- Unified teal accent color
- Consistent information architecture
- Identical workflows and functions
- Professional tone for medical environments

## Design System Components

- [Design System](design-system.md) - Colors, typography, spacing
- [User Flows](user-flows.md) - User guidance through the application
- [Screen Designs](screens/) - Detailed specifications

## Platform Considerations

### Desktop-First Design
- Optimized for mouse precision
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Multi-window support
- System tray integration

### Screen Sizes
- Minimum: 1280x720 (older practice computers)
- Optimal: 1920x1080 (modern standard)
- Maximum: 4K support with scaling

## Information Architecture

### Navigation Pattern: Logo + Tab Navigation

DATEYE uses a unified tab navigation model:
- DATEYE logo on the left for brand identity (180Ã—36px)
- Four main tabs in one row: Dashboard, Connections, History, Settings
- Settings integrated as main navigation tab
- Active tab with blue underline (#0087BA)
- Responsive: Statistics hidden on screens <1200px

This pattern maximizes space efficiency while maintaining accessibility to all functions.

## Success Metrics

Success criteria for DATEYE design:
- Training time under 15 minutes
- No ambiguities in critical actions
- Premium appearance without intimidation
- Reliable function on 5-year-old hardware

## Implementation Status

### Completed
- Visual direction: Professional
- Navigation: Top navigation + dashboard (passive)
- Color palette: Teal as primary color
- Typography: Inter
- Core screens designed

### In Progress
- Component library implementation
- Testing with medical staff
- Dark mode preparation for version 2

### Decisions Made
- **System Tray First**: Application runs in background
- **Passive Dashboard**: Status display only, no direct actions
- **Data Management**: Dedicated screen for import/export
- **Minimal Interaction**: Focus on automation rather than manual control
